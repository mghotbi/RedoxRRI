Description:
    A unified framework for quantifying holobiont-level redox resilience by integrating
    plant physiological traits, soil redox chemistry, and microbial community organization
    into a single interpretable index.
    The package implements the Redox Resilience Index
    (RRI), a weighted composite metric grounded in redox biogeochemistry,
    microbial ecology, and systems biology.
    Multivariate indicators from each domain are reduced to normalized
    one-dimensional latent scores using flexible dimension-reduction methods
    (e.g., PCA, factor analysis, nonlinear embeddings, or co-expression
    networks). Microbial resilience is represented as a blended latent
    component combining abundance or functional composition with network
    organization metrics derived from ecological graphs.
    RedoxRRI is designed for hypothesis-driven research rather than
    black-box prediction, enabling transparent comparison of alternative
    aggregation strategies, domain weights, and ecological contexts.
    The framework supports validation against ecosystem recovery, stress
    tolerance, and biogeochemical function across experimental and
    observational studies.
