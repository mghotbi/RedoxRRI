Description:
    Provides a unified framework for quantifying holobiont-level redox
    resilience by integrating plant physiological traits, soil redox
    chemistry, and microbial features into a single interpretable index.
    The package implements the Redox Resilience Index (RRI), a weighted
    composite metric grounded in redox biogeochemistry, microbial ecology,
    and systems biology. Multivariate indicators from each domain are
    reduced to normalized one-dimensional latent scores using flexible
    dimension-reduction methods, including principal component analysis,
    factor analysis, nonlinear embeddings, and co-expression or network-
    based approaches. Microbial resilience can be represented as a blended
    component combining abundance or functional composition with network
    organization metrics. The framework supports spatial and temporal
    experimental designs and includes fully simulated example data for
    demonstration and testing purposes only.
